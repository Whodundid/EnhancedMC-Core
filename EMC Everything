Known Bugs -- EMC Core 1.0
--------------------------

EMC Core 1.0:
F   1. Object window z-layering

    2. Error thrown when opening screenshot links in chat. (Happens for both InGameChatWindow & GuiChat (but for different reasons))
    
F   3. All EGuiObjects are removed when the entire screen is resized. -------------------------- Unsure on alternative
        -Made it so that all unpinned objects are removed instead
    
F   4. When shift-scrolling EGuiTextAreas, the thumb appears to go beyond the scrollbars boundary.
        --Appears to have been fixed somewhere along the line.
    
F   5. When reloading mod configs from the SettingsGuiMain, the results are not displayed in chat.
        --Added a window instead.
    
F?  6. When resizing an EGuiTextArea, the scrollable dimensions don't seem to properly fit certain objects.
        --From what I can tell, this has since been resolved.
    
F   7. When resizing, an EGuiTextArea will lose all additions to it's document.
        -Objects need to handle this individually.
    
F   8. If a focusLockObject is present, the flashing red border only displays once and never again until reset.
    
F   9. When the fileUpButton is pressed, the new gui does not recieve focus.
    
F   10. FocusLockObject logic is messing up quite hard allowing non headers and focusLockObjects to get focus somehow.
            -Caused by clicking on objects close to the edge of the parent they are in
    
C   11. Right clicking the move button on headers does not reset the window's position.
        --This is probably something that should be left behind at this point now that I think about it
    
F   12. When closing objects, the cursor will become stuck in a resizing image state if the mouse was on a resizeable object's edge when it was closed.
            -Added a check for the EnhancedMCRenerer on pre draw that checks if the cursor has been changed and resets it if there isn't a resizeable object underneath mouse

F-  13. Focus is bugging out randomly. Certain things will not correctly update focus, and sometimes things teleport around.
            -If you click and immediately move the mouse after, the object does not record the mosue release properly
            -The issue appears to be specific to headers with the way they actually clear their modifying state
            -Fixed by clearing the renderer's modify object on header draw calls
                -Introduces another issue that the movement button no longer works when pressed and released..
            
F?  14. When a new gui is opened, it does not get focus.
        --Mostly fixed. There are some visual annoyances with headers due to the way that focus is passed around multiple draw cycles
            -Removed the super.mousePressed call in EGuiButtons and it appears to have visually fixed this (possible unintended consequences)
    
F   15. Objects are drawn below rendered items in the player's hotbar.
    
F   16. Cannot click on scrollbars for some reason.
            -onFocusLost was never being called when the topParent's focused object was cleared
    
F   17. When resizing an object, its' focus is lost.
            -Removed the updateFoucs method from clearing the mofidying type
            --Removed Line: 'if (mod != null && !mod.isResizeable() && mType.equals(ObjectModifyType.Resize)) { objIn.setModifyingObject(mod, ObjectModifyType.None); }'
            -Not Completely, it still loses it if the resizing position is the top right corner
            -Made it so that focus is passed to the window parent if the mouse is over an object edge
    
C   18. Move button on windows does not work at all.
    
F   19. Change EGuiScrollBar to an actionObject.

F?  20. When new data is being added to an EGuiTextArea, if the added data is going to end up going off the window vertically, the added text is shifted significantly below where it should be.
        --Bug magically stopped happening - not sure it is actually gone though
    
F   21. ETerminals require 2 edge clicks in order to activate window resizing.
    
F   22. There is an annoying drawing that occurs for buttons when a window is being resized to the left.
        --Made it so that no objects will be found under the cursor if the topParent is being resized
    
F   23. The cursor can randomly change back to the normal cursor even when around object edges, randomly even.
        --Changed it so the cursor can only change when the top parent isn't resizing an object
        --It still happens and I am not sure why and it's even worse now.....
        --Rewrote the CursorHelper and moved cursor update calls to the topParent
    
F   24. When scrolling over a window that has more than 1 scrollList, all lists scroll even if they are not under the mouse.
        --Restriced the objects to be scrolled in StaticEGuiObject & StaticTopParent to objects who are under the mouse and are drawn.
        
??  25. There was an incredibly strange bug that breifly appeard where old list objects remained in the drawn list layer but were duplicates and not actually part of the list..

F   26. When resizing a scrollList, the horizontal scroll position is based off of the end of the screen, not the start, so it incorrectly moves the list contents.
    
    27. When resizing a scrollList, if the list is scrolled to the bottom and the size becomes smaller than the contents width, the vertical scroll pos is not changed to account for the h scrollbar's height.
    
F   28. The KeyBindGui needs some help with it's minimum dimensions.
        --Further restricted min width/height, made text draw off of ratio positions.
    
F   29. When enabling or disabling submods that require or have mods with dependencies around said mod, nothing is shown in the terminal.
    
F   30. When rrac-ing in the terminal, submod's terminal commands are removed and have no way of being put back.
        --added terminal reload event in submods which gets fired from the terminal handler itself to notfiy submods to replace their commands.

F   31. The resize cursor appears on objects whose edges are under another object.
        --added a check that makes sure only the highestZLevel object can change the cursor image.

F   32. When action objects are fired the parent window is not brought to the front.
    
F   33. Chat history is always fully drawn while the proxy gui is open.
        --Added 3 different drawing modes for chat history with proxies - full, partial, and off.
    
F   34. TextAreaLines are not highlighted when clicking the white space of the line they are on.
    
F   35. When using the arrow keys to traverse through an EGuiTextField's text, the letters appear to shift horizontally.
    
F   36. The KeyBindGui does not show same key assignment conflicts.
        --Added logic to check if the keycode has been assigned more than once.
    
F   37. Anything can be typed into the settings window's search field when just typing while the window itself is focused.
        --Removed the ability to type into search field when it's not focused.
        
F   38. When pressing escape to clear a keybind in the KeyBindGui, the whole gui is closed instead.
        --Added escapeStopper to topParents - an object that prevents the escape key from closing the window and all unpinned guis.
    
F   39. When attempting to assign a mouse button to a KeyBinding in the KeyBindGui, either nothing happens or many many arrows are continually added to the button.

F   40. When a textArea is resized, textLines can no longer be clicked on.
    
F   41. Certain textures are not being drawn.
    
F   42. When resizing a window while the window is at one of it's maximum or minimum widths/heights, any resizing scrollBar thumb will move even though the window doesn't.
    
F   43. TextAreas don't fully show the entire horizontal scroll width, it's cut short by like 10 pixels.
    
    44. GLObject draws (ie. rects, ellipses, etc.) do not seem to accept being scissoring.



EnhancedChat: (MAIN PRIORITY AFTER CORE)
    1. Text/Mouse miss alignment when hovering/clicking on chat (the clickable area appears to be about 3 pixels lower than the text).
        --Not fixed the glitch is somewhat random from what I can tell..

    2. MainRCM is no longer opening.
    
F?  3. NameFinder is not properly isolating names from chat messages.
        --appears to be fixed now
    
F   4. Hovering Events are still drawn even if the chat window is not the highest Z Object under mouse.
    
    5. Config loading issues.
    
F   6. Pinned Chat Windows don't stay pinned when renderer proxy is closed.
    
    7. The new tab button is acting very strange and only opening in certain cases, for instance, if the button was already pressed and is refocused.
    
    8. When pressing enter while a chatWindow is open, the chatWindow is closed (even if it's not in focus) and all other windows remain open (even if they aren't pinned).
    
F   9. InGameChatWindow doesn't open at mouse position from RendererRCM.

    10. New tabs are being created at full size when dragged off a header.
    
    
    
Clear Visuals:

    1. Bug where when toggling fog render, it permanently creates the fog layer which then cannot be fully disabled.

Missing/Broken Quality of Life Issues
-------------------------------------

    1. When using the FileUpButton to return to the main settings gui, the scroll position is not remembered.

F   2. When a vanilla gui is opened, the renderer proxy is effectively closed - breaking the control bridge.
       This would be fine if it weren't for the fact that the EGuiObjects remain on screen.
   
F   3. RCM does not appear for 'MC KeyBinds' button in SettingsGuiMain.

    4. While the scale of everything does change with Minecraft's gui scaling, some objects really do not
       fit well in the larger scales. (ie. InGameChatWindow, MiniMapGui, etc.)
   
     On the largest scaling mode, nothing actually fits well..
     
F   5. When switching worlds, if a proxy gui was open prior to switching, it is closed when exiting.
