Known Bugs -- EMC Core 1.0
--------------------------

EMC Core 1.0:
Y   1. Object window z-layering

    2. Error thrown when opening screenshot links in chat. (Happens for both InGameChatWindow & GuiChat (but for different reasons))

    3. InGameChatWindow doesn't open at mouse position from RendererRCM.
    
    4. All EGuiObjects are removed when the entire screen is resized.
    
    5. When shift-scrolling EGuiTextAreas, the thumb appears to go beyond the scrollbars boundary.
    
    6. When reloading mod configs from the SettingsGuiMain, the results are not displayed in chat.

EnhancedChat: (MAIN PRIORITY AFTER CORE)
    1. Text/Mouse miss alignment when hovering/clicking on chat (the clickable area appears to be about 3 pixels lower than the text).

    2. MainRCM is no longer opening.
    
    3. NameFinder is not properly isolating names from chat messages.
    
    4. Hovering Events are still drawn even if the chat window is not the highest Z Object under mouse.
    
    5. Config loading issues.
    
    6. Pinned Chat Windows don't stay pinned when renderer proxy is closed.

Missing/Broken Quality of Life Issues
-------------------------------------

1. When using the FileUpButton to return to the main settings gui, the scroll position is not remembered.

2. When a vanilla gui is opened, the renderer proxy is effectively closed - breaking the control bridge.
   This would be fine if it weren't for the fact that the EGuiObjects remain on screen.
   
3. RCM does not appear for 'MC KeyBinds' button in SettingsGuiMain.

4. While the scale of everything does change with Minecraft's gui scaling, some objects really do not
   fit well in the larger scales. (ie. InGameChatWindow, MiniMapGui, etc.)
   
   On the largest scaling mode, nothing actually fits well..
