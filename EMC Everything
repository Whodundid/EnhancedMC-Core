Known Bugs -- EMC Core 1.0
--------------------------

EMC Core 1.0:
F   1. Object window z-layering

    2. Error thrown when opening screenshot links in chat. (Happens for both InGameChatWindow & GuiChat (but for different reasons))

    3. InGameChatWindow doesn't open at mouse position from RendererRCM.
    
    4. All EGuiObjects are removed when the entire screen is resized. -------------------------- Unsure on alternative
    
    5. When shift-scrolling EGuiTextAreas, the thumb appears to go beyond the scrollbars boundary.
    
F   6. When reloading mod configs from the SettingsGuiMain, the results are not displayed in chat.
        --Added a window instead.
    
    7. When resizing an EGuiTextArea, the scrollable dimensions don't seem to properly fit certain objects.
    
    8. When resizing, an EGuiTextArea will lose all additions to it's document.
    
F   9. If a focusLockObject is present, the flashing red border only displays once and never again until reset.
    
F   10. When the fileUpButton is pressed, the new gui does not recieve focus.
    
F   11. FocusLockObject logic is messing up quite hard allowing non headers and focusLockObjects to get focus somehow.
            -Caused by clicking on objects close to the edge of the parent they are in
    
C   12. Right clicking the move button on headers does not reset the window's position.
        --This is probably something that should be left behind at this point now that I think about it
    
F   13. When closing objects, the cursor will become stuck in a resizing image state if the mouse was on a resizeable object's edge when it was closed.
            -Added a check for the EnhancedMCRenerer on pre draw that checks if the cursor has been changed and resets it if there isn't a resizeable object underneath mouse

F-  14. Focus is bugging out randomly. Certain things will not correctly update focus, and sometimes things teleport around.
            -If you click and immediately move the mouse after, the object does not record the mosue release properly
            -The issue appears to be specific to headers with the way they actually clear their modifying state
            -Fixed by clearing the renderer's modify object on header draw calls
                -Introduces another issue that the movement button no longer works when pressed and released..
            
F?  15. When a new gui is opened, it does not get focus.
        --Mostly fixed. There are some visual annoyances with headers due to the way that focus is passed around multiple draw cycles
            -Removed the super.mousePressed call in EGuiButtons and it appears to have visually fixed this (possible unintended consequences)
    
    16. Objects are drawn below rendered items in the player's hotbar.
    
F   17. Cannot click on scrollbars for some reason.
            -onFocusLost was never being called when the topParent's focused object was cleared
    
F?  18. When resizing an object, its' focus is lost.
            -Removed the updateFoucs method from clearing the mofidying type
            --Removed Line: 'if (mod != null && !mod.isResizeable() && mType.equals(ObjectModifyType.Resize)) { objIn.setModifyingObject(mod, ObjectModifyType.None); }'
            -Not Completely, it still loses it if the resizing position is the top right corner
    
    19. Move button on windows does not work at all.
    


EnhancedChat: (MAIN PRIORITY AFTER CORE)
    1. Text/Mouse miss alignment when hovering/clicking on chat (the clickable area appears to be about 3 pixels lower than the text).

    2. MainRCM is no longer opening.
    
    3. NameFinder is not properly isolating names from chat messages.
    
    4. Hovering Events are still drawn even if the chat window is not the highest Z Object under mouse.
    
    5. Config loading issues.
    
    6. Pinned Chat Windows don't stay pinned when renderer proxy is closed.

Missing/Broken Quality of Life Issues
-------------------------------------

1. When using the FileUpButton to return to the main settings gui, the scroll position is not remembered.

2. When a vanilla gui is opened, the renderer proxy is effectively closed - breaking the control bridge.
   This would be fine if it weren't for the fact that the EGuiObjects remain on screen.
   
3. RCM does not appear for 'MC KeyBinds' button in SettingsGuiMain.

4. While the scale of everything does change with Minecraft's gui scaling, some objects really do not
   fit well in the larger scales. (ie. InGameChatWindow, MiniMapGui, etc.)
   
   On the largest scaling mode, nothing actually fits well..
